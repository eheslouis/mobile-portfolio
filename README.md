### How to run the application

After copying all the files, open index.html. This is the main page.
To view the different pages, just click on the few links.
For the "Cam's Pizzeria", you can scroll through the page and also change the size of the pizza via the scroll bar.

### My optimization

* After running PageSpeed using Chrome, I followed the suggestions and resized the pizzeria image. The score for mobile and desktop was 92.

* Then I worked on the frame rate and I modified the updatePosition as well as the number of "mover" pizza to improve the frame rate to 60fps.

* Finaly, I modified the changePizzaSizes to optain a resize time of about 1.2ms,
